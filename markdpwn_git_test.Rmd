```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


This report documents my first attempts at version control of a markdown document in git.

Lets create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distaance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
